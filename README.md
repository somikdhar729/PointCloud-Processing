# Point Cloud Processing
Implementation of point cloud operations: generation, Gaussian noise addition/removal, quaternion rotation, translation, and outward normal estimation.

## Features
* Generate open box-shaped point clouds of any size
* Apply and remove Gaussian noise from points
* Rotate point cloud by any input quaternion (normalized or not) about its center
* Translate rotated cloud by arbitrary x,y,z values
* Compute outward-oriented normals for box surfaces
